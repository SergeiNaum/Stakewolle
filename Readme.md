###### The Appendix uses an api to test the validity of the email address [abstractapi.com](https://app.abstractapi.com/api/email-validation/) as the api from emailhunter.co is only available if you have a corporate email.

###### Also I could not install the clearbit library to work with the data enrichment api clearbit.com/enrichment so I decided to write pseudo code as I would do it. This code is commented out because the clearbit library does not work with modern versions of python, and I was afraid to change the version of python in an already working project.

###### Since DRF does not support asynchrony to emit asynchrony in the project I use Celery - mechanism of deferred tasks, how well it worked out for me is for you to judge, I am always open to criticism because it is criticism that makes me a better specialist.
